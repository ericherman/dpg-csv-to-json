As part of the registration and user interaction with the app, Oky captures neither a userâ€™s name, email address, IP address, IMEI number, Wi-Fi Mac address nor any other personal identifier. The Oky functionality also does not allow for the combination of data attributes that might in combination make an individual identifiable. Even if a user would chose her/his full name as username, we would have no way of verifying that the username belongs to a specific person, therefore it is not PII either.

Okyâ€™s data governance system has been set up to protect users and their data. Even though the data is not PII, we would not extract that data.

",No,Unknown,"There is no facilitation between users or contributors, but the question above was mandatory (probably accidentally) so we are adding an explanation here.",This project has no mechanism for interaction between users or contributors,,Yes,"1. The Oky app has been designed with very high privacy settings, to protect users. We do not hold in our database any personally identifiable data. While user-generated fields at time of registration (username, password, secure answer) are not able to identify an individual, as part of Okyâ€™s strict data governance approach, Oky hashes and salts these fields to render the original values inaccessible. This hashing approach is used with the purpose to: (a) obfuscate the username to anyone who might access the database, and (b) to guarantee user authentication, ie. to allow users to log into their account on the same device or a different device.
2. The app has also been designed to be discrete (based on user feedback) so that it is not immediately obvious to anyone else that it is a period tracker - it has a discrete icon, the interface does not look like a traditional period tracker app (for anyone looking over a userâ€™s shoulder), and it will only send discrete messages to users via the push notification from CMS. For example, messages will never be sent that give away personal information that others may see. The Do-No-Harm principle is imperative. For example, messages like 'your period is late, you might be pregnant' would never be sent.
3. Users require a passcode to access their account on the app, to protect their account and information (especially for users who may share phones). They are required to enter their passcode every time they open the app; this is the default. Users also set up a  memorable question and answer if they lose their passcode, but this cannot be reset from the backend if users forget it, to protect user data.
4. Content has been created and vetted by experts, and some content (eg quizzes and did you knows) has had age-restrictions added for users aged 15 (according to their account profile) and below. This is to protect younger users from content that may not be deemed age appropriate (and that they cannot control seeing, as the quizzes appear at random).
5. Efforts have been made to engage parents and caregivers, through the website, to inform them of what Oky is and what it is for.

VivoosVR,Virtual Reality based software tool to aid mental health professionals in treatment of psychological disorders.  ,Ideasis / Turkey,https://www.vivoosvr.com/vivoosvr-en,Open Source Software,https://github.com/Ideasis/VivoosVR,"3: Good Health and Well-Being, 10: Reduced Inequalities","There are approximately 700 million people suffering from mental health issues in general, most of them suffer from anxiety related disorders including phobias, depression and similar conditions where in many cases comorbidity of two or more conditions is present. Especially people living in conflict areas and/or developing or underdeveloped areas are more likely to experience severe mental disorders. Lack of availability of quality mental health care is another problem for above mentioned regions. Globally, 75% of people with mental health conditions remain untreated. 
Pandemic related anxiety is another rapidly rising problem. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is drastically changing the way of life. Workplaces, schools, universities have closed. Socializing with friends and family is highly discouraged. These circumstances have a significant negative effect on our social, physical and mental wellbeing. As, Dr Brock Chisholm, the first Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), stated â€œwithout mental health there can be no true physical health.
 Our solution targets to: 
â€¢	Improve mental health care, provide a quicker, safer and more cost effective way to deal with anxiety.
â€¢	Help reduce the global suicide rate, providing that depression is one of the major causes of suicide, which is in comorbidity with anxiety disorders.
â€¢	Decrease the burden on the social security systems, by reducing therapy costs and time while contributing to the effectiveness of the treatments.
â€¢	Provide an opportunity for low income and displaced individuals to receive mental health treatment, due to the ease of use with reduced cost and time, more people can get treatment during the same time / cost provided.

Below is an academic article published on the methodology and findings of our pilot.

SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth
Research has shown that people with anxiety have higher unemployment rates and are more likely to settle for lower incomes.
Five of the 10 leading causes of disability worldwide are mental problems (major depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, alcohol use and obsessive-compulsive disorders). These disorders â€“ together with anxiety, depression and stress â€“ have a definitive impact on any working population and should be addressed within that context. They may also develop into long-term disorders with accompanying forms of disability
Literature consistently demonstrates that social anxiety disorder has substantial impacts on occupational functioning. Work-related impairments for persons with social anxiety disorder include reduced productivity and job performance, lowered educational attainment, unemployment, financial dependence, and reduced income. Approximately 20% of persons with social anxiety disorder reported declining a job offer or promotion due to social fears and primary care patients with social anxiety disorder reported significantly greater absenteeism and reduced productivity compared to patients without psychiatric problems.

",Yes,VivoosVR is software tool designed to help conduct exposure therapy in a more cost effective way. It is based on already established therapy methods and techniques. It has been built by and for certified mental health professionals. Our solution is in adherence with applicable laws and regulations. It is in use at psychology clinics in accordance with the relevant laws.  ,Unknown,,,Yes,"From a software development standpoint, we have made sure to follow best practices in order to ensure that our simulations have a high comfort rating with no motion sickness inducing elements. Stable frame rates are a must for VR experiences. Our simulations have been optimized to run at a stable frame per second on a variety of hardware. Artificial camera movements can have a negative impact on the comfort level of a VR experience. For this reason, we have implemented a teleportation based locomotion system and refrained from using any artificial camera movements which could induce motion sickness.
On the other hand, our simulation scenarious have been developed in collaboration with universities and clinicians specializing in the fields of psychology and psychiatry. Therefore, the exposure methodoly that our simulations are based on is in accordance with the best practicies in the field of mental health. Additionaly, relevant literature around the world have been reviewed prior to begin development. 
Our solution also incorprates pulse and galvanic skin response sensors to measure stress levels as a practice widely used and accepted in the field.
